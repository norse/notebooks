Each of the 10 inputs (indexed from 0 to 9) will sent to the same neuron at every timestep, setting the size of our previously arbitrary sized population to 10. In the setup below, the input voltages follow the formula $i_n * 0.2$, where $i_n$ is the neuron index. Meaning, neuron 0 will receive an input of 0 for each timestep, so we do not expect that to spike. Neuron 1 will receive 0.2, so that *could* be enough for it to spike. Neuron 9 will receive an input of 1.80 every timestep, so we expect that to spike quite a few times."
