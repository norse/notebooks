# Norse Notebook Tutorials

These notebooks are designed to familiarize yourself with the [Spiking Neural
Network simulator, Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse).
You are welcome to clone and run the notebooks
locally, but we also links to 
[Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) where you can run
them in your browser for free.

Note that you can run the code both using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. If you run the code on Google collaboratory, select `Runtime -> Change Runtime Type` to run the models on GPUs or TPUs. That will also run significantly faster and save a lot of your time.
