    "Norse provides two necessary requirements for scaling spiking neural network simulations to cluster-wide simulations: a solid infrastructure (PyTorch) and proper state handling. PyTorch permits us to apply a highly developed toolchain (as we will see in a minute) to solve our problems. This saves a dramatic amount of time. Proper state handling permits us to paralellize our simulations, which is practically impossible in many other neuron simulators.\n",

    "In this small tutorial, you will learn to use Norse with the PyTorch-based framework, [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (PL). PL makes it *lightning*-fast (pun intended I'm sure) to build and scale your networks.\n",
