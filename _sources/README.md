# Norse Notebook Tutorials

These notebooks are designed to familiarize yourself with the [Spiking Neural Network simulator, Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse).
This material can be **run the notebooks directly in your browser**.
However, please note that the online execution relies on CPU, which can cause performance problems for larger networks.
If you desire hardware acceleration (like GPU or TPU) you can either clone this repository and experiment locally, or use Google Colab.

If this is your first brush with computational neuroscience, we recommend [this excellent serious of tutorials by Neuromatch Academy](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W0D1_PythonWorkshop1/student/W0D1_Tutorial1.html).
They provide excellent interactive tutorials on neuron dynamics, linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and deep learning.
